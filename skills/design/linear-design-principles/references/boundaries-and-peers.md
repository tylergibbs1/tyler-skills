# Boundaries: where Linear's principles have limits

The rest of this skill is confident in Linear's opinions on purpose — a coherent point of view is the whole value. But Linear's answers are **conditional, not universal**. Peer companies with comparable craft reach *opposite* conclusions in some cases, and they are right for the products they build. This file names those boundaries so the skill gives correct advice even when the user isn't building a Linear-shaped product.

Each boundary states Linear's position, the peer's, the **deciding variable** (what determines which one applies), and how to frame it. These are boundaries, not debates — when you know the deciding variable, you know which answer is right.

The companion to this file is the **corroboration table** at the end: where independent companies and the broader design canon reached the *same* conclusion as Linear (which makes those principles more credible, not Linear-specific dogma).

## 1. Opinionated "one good way" vs. flexibility / extensibility / ecosystem

- **Linear (P1, P2):** Ship one really good way; be opinionated; sometimes the answer is "no."
- **Peers:** Notion (blocks/LEGO, user-as-toolmaker), Raycast (an extension ecosystem for the long tail), shadcn/ui (you own the code), Figma (an infinite canvas, not a fixed workflow), Vercel (a platform).
- **Deciding variable:** *How knowable and homogeneous is the user's job, and is the artifact shared or personal?* Linear is right for a **bounded, knowable, shared workflow** (issue tracking for software teams) — opinionation removes decisions and produces calm. The peers are right for **unknowably diverse users (platforms), a creative substrate (canvases, IDEs), or a single-user power tool** — there a fixed "one way" excludes most of the audience.
- **Frame:** Whichever you pick, you owe the user the *opposite* counterweight. Opinionated apps need escape hatches; flexible products need templates and a guided first run (Notion's own answer to the blank-page problem). For the long tail of requests, both "no" (Linear) and "yes, via an extension" (Raycast) are legitimate scope strategies — they just put the extensibility burden in different places.

## 2. Taste decides vs. metrics / evals decide

- **Linear:** Taste decides; dogfooding and betas validate. No OKRs, no A/B tests as arbiters, "data can be a crutch."
- **Peers:** Superhuman (the 40% "very disappointed" PMF survey as the central metric), Intercom (RICE, a Product Impact Framework, proxy metrics), The Browser Company (killed Arc partly on adoption telemetry — and has said publicly it trusted taste/vision too long), Anthropic/LangChain (systematic agent evals).
- **Deciding variable:** *Stage, signal density, scale, and determinism.* Taste wins for **atomic craft decisions, mature conviction, deterministic hand-reviewable UI, and small aligned teams.** Metrics/evals win **pre-PMF (Superhuman), at the strategic "is anyone actually adopting this?" altitude (Arc), when many stakeholders must align on priority (RICE), and for non-deterministic features you cannot eyeball (agents).**
- **Frame:** "Taste tells you if it's good; metrics tell you if it's being adopted — and those two can diverge for years." Linear's stance is safest once you already have conviction and a deterministic surface; it is most dangerous pre-PMF and for stochastic features.

## 3. The Linear Method vs. Shape Up

- **Linear:** Short continuous **cycles** (~2 weeks), a curated near-term backlog ("delete the backlog" as hygiene), always-assigned named owners.
- **Peer:** Basecamp's **Shape Up** — six-week **bets**, **no backlog at all**, a fixed **appetite** (time budget you design scope down to fit), a **cooldown** between cycles, and a **circuit breaker** (a project that misses its appetite stops by default rather than getting an extension).
- **Deciding variable:** *Iteration frequency and how you want focus protected.* Linear suits high-frequency iterative work where momentum and visible ownership matter. Shape Up suits teams that want long, uninterrupted, protected focus and reject the false obligation of an ever-growing list.
- **Frame:** "Linear deletes the backlog as hygiene; 37signals questions whether it should exist at all." Appetite (fix the time, shape scope to fit — the inverse of estimating) and the circuit breaker are the two Shape Up ideas the Linear Method lacks; both are worth offering when a team feels rushed or perpetually behind.

## 4. Keep MVPs internal until ready vs. ship-to-learn in production

- **Linear:** Keep MVPs internal until they're ready; protect a calm, papercut-free first impression; validate via dogfooding then optional beta.
- **Peers:** Intercom (ship "uncomfortably early," even incomplete, to real customers — "shipping is the beginning, not the end"), Vercel ("iterate to greatness" in public).
- **Deciding variable:** *Blast radius, reversibility, and whether your brand promise is "polished" or "fast-improving."* Linear's brand is staked on polish, so a rough first impression is expensive. Intercom/Vercel front-load learning because only real usage reveals the truth — viable when you have feature-flag and fast-rollback infrastructure that keeps each release low-risk.
- **Frame:** The more your brand promise *is* polish, the more Linear's "internal until ready" holds; the more your edge is learning speed (and the cheaper a rollback), the more shipping rough-but-real wins.

## 5. Keyboard-first "remember and type" vs. see-and-point discoverability

- **Linear (P6):** Keyboard as a primary input; command palette over the local object pool; the fastest path beats a mouse and three menus.
- **Peer:** Apple HIG — see-and-point, direct manipulation, recognition over recall.
- **Deciding variable:** *User frequency and expertise.* Keyboard-first pays off **only for daily expert users** who have internalized the shortcuts. For occasional users, rarely-used surfaces, or touch, recall is a tax and see-and-point wins. The skill already concedes it has "no mobile philosophy" — this is the same boundary, named.
- **Frame:** Superhuman shows the bridge: a command palette that *teaches* its shortcuts (showing the keystroke next to each action) migrates users up the speed curve instead of demanding expertise on day one. Offer the keyboard path; don't make it the only path for infrequent actions.

## 6. Bold redesigns / "decisively wrong and pivot" vs. never break the contract

- **Linear:** Better to be decisively wrong and pivot than cautiously mediocre; holistic redesigns are healthy; "no software design is truly timeless."
- **Peer:** Stripe — API versioning, account pinning, additive-only change; a "pivot" to a public interface is a production outage for everyone depending on it.
- **Deciding variable:** *Is the interface consumed by humans or by other software?* Humans re-learn a redesign overnight, so pivoting is cheap. APIs, file formats, schemas, and public SDKs are embedded in running code — there a redesign breaks callers.
- **Frame:** "The more your interface is a contract other software depends on, the more Linear's 'move fast and redesign' must invert into Stripe's 'never break, only extend.'" The visual UI can pivot; the contract can only grow.

## 7. Tacit taste / no formal review vs. codified, machine-readable craft

- **Linear:** No formal design reviews; taste is tacit, applied continuously by a small high-taste team; async feedback in project channels.
- **Peers:** Vercel (its Web Interface Guidelines shipped as an agent command/linter), Stripe (a formal API Review gate).
- **Deciding variable:** *Team scale, and whether agents must apply the standard.* Tacit taste scales with a small, aligned, high-taste team. Codified rules scale across a large org **and** — crucially in the agent era — let AI agents apply and check craft consistently.
- **Frame:** This is the one place Linear's deliberately-tacit model has a real disadvantage: **machines can't read taste.** If agents are part of how your craft gets produced or reviewed, some of it has to be written down.

## 8. Calm restraint vs. engineered delight / depth / motion

- **Linear (P5):** Calm, recessive, restraint; "structure felt, not seen"; the only animation lesson is "make the hover fade invisible."
- **Peers:** Superhuman (game design, deliberate peak moments like Inbox Zero), Apple ("Depth"), Airbnb/Things (expressive, communicative motion as a shipped artifact).
- **Deciding variable:** *Usage frequency and emotional register.* Calm-and-recessive is right for **high-frequency, all-day work surfaces** where flourish becomes fatigue (Linear's issue lists). Engineered peak moments and expressive motion are right at **emotional milestones, habit formation, and consumer/personal apps.**
- **Frame:** The same product can want both — a calm steady state punctuated by deliberate delight, which the skill currently under-weights. The test for any flourish: does it mark a genuine moment, or does it fire on every routine action? Confetti on *every* data refresh fails; confetti once at a real milestone can earn its place.

## Corroboration: where the canon independently agrees with Linear

These are *not* contradictions — they're independent companies and classic design canon reaching Linear's exact conclusion. Cite them to convert "Linear says" into "the canon of good design says, and Linear codified it."
